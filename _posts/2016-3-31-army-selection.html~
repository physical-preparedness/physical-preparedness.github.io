title: Physical Fitness Tests and Standards in Army
---

Can you pass physical fitness tests in various countries? Do you match military fitness standards? In this post are described various physical fitness tests and standards used around the World.

<p>
In this post the physical fitness tests of several armies are presented. And at the end of the post is conlusion of common trends in design of such a tests today.

<h2>Tests by Countries</h2>

<h3>United States Army Physical Fitness Test</h3>

The US army uses the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) according to the FM 7-22 Army Physical Readiness Training (<a href="http://www.lsu.edu/hss/milsci/resources/fm7_22.pdf">see</a>).
Soldiers are evaluated based on their performance in three events:
<ul>
    <li><span class="emp">Push-ups</span> (lower position - upper arms at least parralel to the ground)</li>
    <li><span class="emp">Sit-ups</span> (with ankles holded by another person)</li>
    <li><span class="emp">2-mile run</span></li>
</ul> 
In following tables are shown the minimum required scores to pass the test and the maximal possible score. To pass the test, you have to pass all three events. The minimal requirement for all events are shown in following table.

<h3>United Kingdom Army Fitness Standards</h3>
<p>
The UK army standards (<a href="http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/ADSC_Fitness_Selection_Standards.pdf">see</a>) with the explanation (<a href="http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/parachute/26245.aspx">see</a>) consist of five events:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="emp">2.4 km run<span> (it should be completed in 9:40 or less)</li>
    <li><span class="emp">Lift of a weighted bag</span> of 40 kg to a height of 1.45 metres</li>
    <li><span class="emp">Jerry can test</span> - carry two 20 kg water containers over a set course of 120 metres. The course should be completed in two minutes or less</li>
    <li><span class="emp">Press-ups</span> - a minimum of 44 in two minutes</li>
    <li><span class="emp">Sit-ups</span> - a minimum of 50 in two minutes</li>
</ul> 


<h3>French Foreign Legion Sports Tests</h3>
<p>
The Sports Tests can be found at Foreing Legion pages (<a href="http://foreignlegion.info/joining/">see</a>). The tests consist of just two events:    
<ul>
    <li><span class="emp">Multi-stage fitness test</span> (20-m shuttle run test, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-stage_fitness_test">see this link</a>). It is required to complete at least level 7.</li>
    <li><span class="emp">Pull-ups</span> - 4 repetions are enough</li>
</ul>  
</p>
<p>
Interesting thing is that they also require body mass index (BMI) in range 20-30.
</p>  
    
<h3>Australian Army Pre-entry Fitness Assessment</h3>
<p>
The physical test is described at pages of Australian ministry of defense (<a href="http://www.defencejobs.gov.au/campaigns/fitness/">see</a>). The test consists of three events:
<ul>
    <li><span class="emp">Push-ups</span></li>
    <li><span class="emp">Sit-ups</span> (feet held)</li>
    <li><span class="emp">Multi-stage fitness test</span> (20-m shuttle run test, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-stage_fitness_test">see this link</a>). It is required to complete at least lever 7.5</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The male requirements are 15 push-ups, 45 sit-ups, 7.5 shuttle run score.
The Female requirements are 8 push-ups, 45 sit-ups, 7.5 shuttle run score.
For Special Forces Direct Recruiting Scheme (SFDRS) candidates, the requirement are 30 push-ups, 60 sit-ups, 10.1 shuttle run level.
</p>
 
    
    
<h3>Canadian Forces Minimum Physical Fitness Standard</h3>
<p>
The Canadian Forces developed the Minimum Physical Fitness Standard (FORCE) according to research of common military tasks, which all personnel might be expected to perform. If you want to know more, than <a href="https://www.cfmws.com/en/AboutUs/PSP/DFIT/Fitness/FORCEprogram/Pages/default.aspx">see this page</a> about FORCE. From their research they conclude to tests these four standards:
<ul>
    <li><span class="emp">Sandbag lifts</span> - 30 consecutive lifts of a 20 kg sandbag from the floor above a height of 1.0 m. The member alternates between left and right sandbags separated by 1.25 m. This event should be completed in 3 minutes and 30 seconds</li>
    <li><span class="emp">Intermittent Loaded Shuttles</span> - 10 consecutive shuttles (1 shuttle = 20 m there, 20 m back), alternating between loaded shuttles with a 20 kg sandbag and unloaded shuttles, totaling 400 m. It should be completed in 5 minutes and 21 seconds.</li>
    <li><span class="emp">Sandbag drag</span> - Carry one 20 kg sandbag and pull a minimum of four on the floor over 20 m without stopping. Number of sandbags being dragged depends on the type of floor.â€‹</li>
    <li><span class="emp">20 metre rushes</span> - Starting from the prone position, complete two shuttle sprints (1 shuttle = 20 m there, 20 m back) dropping to the prone position every 10 m for a total of 80 m. It should be completed in 51 seconds or less.</li>   
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I would like to also mention, that they provide internet <a href="https://www.dfit.ca/forceprofile">application</a>, which can calculate how operationally fit and healthy you are according to your FORCE score.

<h3>Israeli Army Fitness Test</h3>
<p>
The test used by Israeli Army was invented by Professor Oded Bar Or (<a href="http://garinmahal.com/getting-started/idf-fitness-test">see</a>). Since the 2014 the test consists of three events:
<ul>
    <li><span class="emp">Pull-ups</span> - at least 11 reps are required.</li>
    <li><span class="emp">Dips</span> - Arms must decend 90 degress, at least 18 reps are required.</li>
    <li><span class="emp">3000 meter run</span> (1.86 miles) - you have to finish under 15:33.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Before this test, they use a different test, that consist of sit-ups, push-ups and 2000 metres run.
This test used elaborated point system.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
From the tests mentioned above, it seems that the traditional combination of tests consist of push-ups, sit-ups and running. However some armies replace this combination with new selections recently. It seems that this trend is due to army research in this field. Today's trend is to replace the sit-ups (at least sit-ups) with something like weighted carries and/or lifting heavy things, what seems to be more related to purpose of the military selection tests.
</p>
<p>
Also it si worthy to mention this paper (<a href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/18614935">see</a>). In the paper it is concluded that the tradional tests (push-ups, sit-ups, running) is easier to pass for lighter people. Those people are in general less suitable for tasks related to absolute strenght (carring, loading and lifting heavy stuff). And according to research of Canadian Forces those tasks are the most common in army.
